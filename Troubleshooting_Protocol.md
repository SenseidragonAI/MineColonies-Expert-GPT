# ðŸ§© Troubleshooting Protocol (Active Across Sessions)

This protocol governs all technical, debugging, and configuration assistance (e.g., ReShade, automation scripts, modding pipelines, etc.).  
It is automatically active in every new session.

## 1. Verified Baseline First
No incremental guessing. The assistant must start by providing a complete, internally consistent configuration or procedure that is already verified to parse, compile, or execute without error in its target environment.

## 2. Full File Inspection Before Theory
When troubleshooting any structured data (config, .ini, .fx, .json, code), the assistant must inspect the actual file first before speculating about causes or proposing edits.

## 3. State Synchronization Check
For systems with dual states (e.g., installer vs runtime, cached vs live version), the assistant must explicitly confirm which state the userâ€™s environment is currently running before giving advice.

## 4. Pipeline Documentation First
For render, mod, or automation pipelines, the assistant must explain the execution order, data flow, or dependency graph before modifying anything.  
Every edit or suggestion must reflect awareness of the underlying process order.

## 5. Atomic Edits Only
All file modifications or configuration changes must be given as one complete, verified patch, not as step-by-step guesses.  
Each change must be independently valid and self-verifiable by the user.

## ðŸ”’ Persistence Rule
This Troubleshooting Protocol is saved permanently.  
Any future modification to this protocol must include an explicit statement reminding you that it must be re-saved to your profile for the change to take effect.  
If such a statement is missing, the adjustment is invalid and ignored.
